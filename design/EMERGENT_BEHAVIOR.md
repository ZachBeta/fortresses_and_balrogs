# Emergent Behavior Systems

## 1. AI Behavior Framework

### 1.1 Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)
- **Needs-Based AI**
  - Each NPC has needs (hunger, rest, safety)
  - Needs influence decision-making
  - Example: Hungry orc → Find food → Hunt or steal

- **Personality Traits**
  - Brave/Cowardly
  - Aggressive/Passive
  - Curious/Unobservant

### 1.2 State Machine Implementation
```rust
enum AiState {
    Idle,
    Patrol(Vec<(i32, i32)>),
    Chase(EntityId),
    Flee(EntityId),
    Search(Point),
    UseObject(EntityId),
}

struct AiMemory {
    last_seen: HashMap<EntityId, (Point, u32)>,
    known_danger_zones: Vec<(Point, u32)>,
    relationships: HashMap<EntityId, i8>, // -100 to 100
}
```

## 2. Fellowship Dynamics

### 2.1 Group Behavior
- **Formation Movement**
  - Leader sets pace and path
  - Others maintain position
  - Rear guard watches for threats

- **Morale System**
  - Affected by events and conditions
  - Impacts effectiveness in combat
  - Can trigger special dialogues

### 2.2 Relationship System
- **Trust Levels**
  - Between party members
  - With NPC factions
  - Changes through actions and dialogue

- **Group Decisions**
  - Voting on major choices
  - Leadership challenges
  - Potential for betrayal

## 3. Environmental Interactions

### 3.1 Dynamic Events
- **Collapsing Structures**
  - Block paths
  - Create hazards
  - Alert enemies

- **Light and Shadow**
  - Affects visibility
  - Changes behavior patterns
  - Creates stealth opportunities

### 3.2 Sound Propagation
- **Noise Levels**
  - Footsteps on different surfaces
  - Combat sounds
  - Environmental sounds (water, wind)

- **Hearing Ranges**
  - Different for each race
  - Affected by environment
  - Can trigger investigations

## 4. Combat Emergence

### 4.1 Tactical AI
- **Flanking**
  - Enemies try to surround
  - Protect vulnerable allies
  - Use chokepoints

- **Retreat and Regroup**
  - Fall back when injured
  - Call for reinforcements
  - Set ambushes

### 4.2 Environmental Combat
- **Interactive Elements**
  - Push enemies into pits
  - Collapse ceilings
  - Use levers and traps

## 5. Economy and Resources

### 5.1 Dynamic Economy
- **Scarce Resources**
  - Food and water management
  - Torch duration
  - Equipment durability

### 5.2 Crafting and Upgrades
- **Improvisation**
  - Create tools from found items
  - Repair equipment
  - Set traps

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 MVP Features
1. Basic enemy AI (patrol, chase, attack)
2. Simple morale system
3. Basic sound propagation
4. Environmental interactions

### 6.2 Future Expansion
- Advanced group tactics
- Complex social dynamics
- Dynamic quest generation
- Faction reputation system

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Performance
- Spatial partitioning for AI awareness
- Event queue for delayed reactions
- Behavior tree optimizations

### 7.2 Modding Support
- Scriptable behaviors
- Custom events and triggers
- Modifiable decision weights

## 8. Testing Plan

### 8.1 Test Cases
1. Enemy reactions to player actions
2. Party member interactions
3. Environmental chain reactions
4. Resource management scenarios

### 8.2 Metrics
- Engagement time
- Player choices
- Emergent story moments
- Bug reports
