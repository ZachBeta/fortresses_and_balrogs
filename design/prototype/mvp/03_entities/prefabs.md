  - Stealth: 15
  - Perception: 12
  - Courage: 14

## Ringwraiths (Nazg√ªl)

- **Stats**:
  - Speed: 6 (faster than hobbits)
  - Stealth: 10

## Notes
- All stats are on a 1-20 scale, as in FELLOWSHIP_STATS.md.
- Courage may be used for future fear/stealth mechanics.
- Additional fields (inventory, health, etc.) can be added in later phases.
- Prefabs can be extended for new scenarios (e.g., Aragorn, Weathertop, etc.).
